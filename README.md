# Project-2-Group-4

This project contains two different problems: Web Scraping & APIs

1. Scraping a table from a webpage, where the table must have at least 30 records and store the results in a dataframe(called df1). Then use the values from ONE column of this dataframe as parameters to make requests to a API. Store the data return from the API in another dataframe(called df2). Lastly merge the dataframe(name it df3). Convert the combined dataframe into a csv file and organize it in a sql database.

2. Implementing a Python program that scrapes roster data for CUNY athletic teams (men’s swimming, men’s volleyball, women’s swimming, women’s volleyball), processes player height information, and stores it in both CSV and SQLite database formats. The program calculates average heights, identifies the tallest and shortest players, and outputs findings for analysis.
